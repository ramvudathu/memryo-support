      <h2>Detailed description</h2>
      <p>Memryo helps you never forget the past. It's a simple, private activity tracker for recurring tasks, maintenance, and habits—with one-tap logging and a clear timeline so you always know when you last did something.</p>

      <h3>Smart activity management</h3>
      <p>Choose from common activities or create your own. Set how often each one repeats (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly) and organize everything by category.</p>

      <h3>One-tap "Remember it" button</h3>
      <p>Log the current date and time in one tap. Perfect when you're busy and just want to record that you did it.</p>

      <h3>Timeline history</h3>
      <p>View all your events in a simple timeline. Filter by activity, see patterns, and never wonder "when did I last…?" again. <a href="timeline-sample.html">See a sample timeline</a>.</p>

      <h3>Notes on events</h3>
      <p>Add notes to any event (e.g. "Oil changed at 45,000 miles" or "Filter size: 20x25"). Edit or delete events anytime.</p>

      <h3>100% customizable — make it truly yours</h3>
      <p>Your categories, your activity names, your recurrence (hourly to yearly). Start with built-in templates or create everything from scratch. Memryo doesn't impose a structure; you design the app around your life.</p>

      <h3>Privacy-first</h3>
      <p>All data is stored only on your device. We don't collect, transmit, or store your information on our servers. No account or sign-in required.</p>

      <h3>Who it's for</h3>
      <p>Anyone who forgets when they last did routine tasks; people tracking home or car maintenance; anyone building habits or tracking recurring health tasks; small teams or individuals who want timestamped records without spreadsheets.</p>

      <p>Memryo is free to use. Your data stays on your phone—private and under your control.</p>
